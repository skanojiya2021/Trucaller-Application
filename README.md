# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# List View (Multiple Posts):

Data Fetching: Retrieves the most recent posts and categories from the API.
Filtering: Implements category filtering using a select box, updating the API request dynamically.
Rendering: Displays each post as a card with categories, thumbnail, title, and formatted date. Clicking a card navigates to the post's detail view.
Pagination: Supports loading older posts by updating the API request with a page parameter.

# Detail View (Single Post):
Dynamic Routing: Uses React Router for routing based on post slug.
Data Fetching: Fetches a single post's details including featured image, title, author, date, and content.

# Responsive Design:
CSS: Uses flexbox and media queries (@media) to ensure the layout adjusts smoothly across different screen sizes.
Assumptions: Assumes basic understanding of React.js, API integration, and CSS for responsive web design. Simplifies error handling and focuses on core functionality without advanced features like state caching or complex animations.
